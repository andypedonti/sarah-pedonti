                         Special Education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
                          She works under the mentorship of Dr. Kathryn Leech and Dr. Harriet Able 
                          investigating the language and literacy development of young children,
                           including dual language learners and children with disabilities, in the home and school contexts.
                            Her dissertation, funded by the ACF OPRE Head Start Research Scholars program, uses 
                            secondary data from the Migrant and Seasonal Head Start Study (Caswell et al., 2017), combined
                             with administrative Head Start data to explore relations between disability coordination in
                              Head Start and dual language learner's language and literacy outcomes. Sarah has worked on 
                              several IES- and OSEP-funded interinstitutional projects, including a multi-year randomized 
                              control trial of the Targeted Reading Intervention, the STEM Innovation for Inclusion in Early
