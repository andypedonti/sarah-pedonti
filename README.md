# Personal Website for Sarah Pedonti

### Description
This is a basic, static website to display a digital resume in the form of a website for my wife as she enters the job search phase of her PHD program. 

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

#### Construction
For this project I used bootstrap to build it so as to minimize the amount of CSS that needed to be written and speed the developement process. Background colors and margins and padding were done with the aid of CSS. 

### Further Development
It is my intention to make a template from this project that other PHD candidates could simply fork the repository and add the needed information to make their own resume website with it.
